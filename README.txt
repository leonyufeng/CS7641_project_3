# Project 3: Supervised Learning
Author: Yu Feng  
GID: yfeng40
__________________________________________________________

The project can be clone from https://github.com/leonyufeng/CS7641_project_3
By commend `git clone https://github.com/leonyufeng/CS7641_project_3`

You can run this project by creating a conda environment and using Jupyter Notebook.  
There are two notebooks `covid_death_clustering.ipynb` and `credit_score_clustering.ipynb` for COVID Death classification and Credit Score classification cases.

# 1. Getting data
The Mexican COVID Death classification can be downloaded at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meirnizri/covid19-dataset?resource=download. The Credit Score classification dataset can be download at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification .  
  
The two datasets are also included in the data folder. In case itâ€™s not included due to uploading limit, please do download the data from the web links provided above. And put the two dataset css files into `data` folder with correct name `credit_score_dataset.csv` and `covid_death_dataset.csv`. 

# 2. Run the notebook cases
To successfully run the code, first make sure you download or use the existing datasets under `data` folder with correct name `credit_score_dataset.csv` and `covid_death_dataset.csv`.
 
## 2.1 Environment setup
1) Install Anaconda or miniconda from  
`https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html` 

2) Create conda environment by  
`conda create -n CS6741_SL python=3.8`
3) Then install libraries at project root by 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

Since the project only asked for analysis.pdf and README.txt, Therefore, you can also install the python libraries by
`pip install pandas scikit-learn`
`pip install matplotlib`  
`pip install jupyter`   
`pip install ipykernel`

4) Add kernel to jupyter notebook by  
`python -m ipykernel install --user --name CS6741_SL`

## 2.2 Open jupyter notebook
1) Open jupyter notebook case
Open jupyter notebook from terminal by
`jupyter notebook`
2) Change kernel from Jupyter Notebook Menu Kernel/Change Kernel to CS6741_SL

## 2.3 Run through the notebook
There are two notebooks `covid_death_clustering.ipynb` and `credit_score_clustering.ipynb` for COVID Death clustering and Credit Score clustering cases.

You can simply use `run all` under menu `run` to run through each notebook. But be aware that, each notebook will run over 1 hour due to the size of the data.
  
## 2.4 Run results
The results can be find in notebook for each case. The result plots can also be found under result_plots folder if uploading successfully.
